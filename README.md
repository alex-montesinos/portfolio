# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project serves as both a learning tool for HTML and a place to showcase who I am, what Iâ€™ve done, and what I plan to build.

## ðŸ“š Purpose

I created this site to:
- Learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and eventually JavaScript
- Build a professional portfolio that reflects my interests and skills
- Continuously add new features, sections, and projects as I grow

## ðŸš€ Features

- About Me section
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Light/Dark mode toggle
- Resume Download

## ðŸ“¬ Contact

If you have feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out via GitHub issues or connect through my LinkedIn.
